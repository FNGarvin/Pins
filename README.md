## How to Play

The game board consists of three rows of pins. On your turn, you must remove one or more *contiguous* pins from a single row. The player who is forced to take the very last pin on the board loses the game.

-   **To make a move:** Click and drag to draw a selection box over any number of *contiguous* pins in a single row.
-   **The Goal:** Force your opponent to take the last pin.
